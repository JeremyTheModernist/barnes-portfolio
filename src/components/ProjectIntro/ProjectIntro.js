          Tres Solutions is data analytics company supplying insightful metrics and feedback to vessel industries world wide. When Tres approached me, they we’re looking for a complete web redesign. The challenge was not only to create a brand image that differentiated Tres from their competitors, but more importantly, to create a visual and verbal language that would build trust with potential customers and communicate the value of Tres.

          <h3 class="challenge__header"> Solution </h3>
          My first step with Tres was to understand the unique value propositions of their company, and perform a competitive analysis. From there, I built a series of moodboards and initial design directions oriented around my findings. These initial directions would go onto define the larger rebrand and site architecture for Tres. The result was a comprehensive website detailing the unique offerings of Tres’ product and the value they offer customers.
